Here, we used multi-point tracking (DeepLabCut) and behavioral segmentation (MoSeq) to characterize the behavior of mice freely interacting with a novel object. Novelty elicits a characteristic sequence of behavior, starting with investigatory approach and culminating in object engagement or avoidance. Dopamine in the tail of the striatum (TS) suppresses engagement, and dopamine responses were predictive of individual variability in behavior. Behavioral dynamics and individual variability are explained by a reinforcement-learning (RL) model of threat prediction in which behavior arises from a novelty-induced initial threat prediction (akin to ‘‘shaping bonus’’) and a threat prediction that is learned through dopamine-mediated threat prediction errors. These results uncover an algorithmic similarity between reward- and threat-related dopamine sub-systems.},

Here, we combined placebo and explore-exploit paradigms to examine detection and selection of the most effective treatment in a pain model. During conditioning, where ‘optimal’ and ‘suboptimal’ sham-treatments were paired with a reduction in electrical pain stimulation, participants learnt which treatment most successfully reduced pain. Modelling participant responses revealed three important findings. First, participants’ choices reflected both directed and random exploration. Second, expectancy modulated pain – indicative of recursive placebo effects. Third, individual differences in terms of expectancy during conditioning predicted placebo effects during a subsequent test phase. These findings reveal directed and random exploration when the outcome is biologically-relevant. Moreover, this research shows how placebo and explore-exploit literatures can be unified.},

  abstract = {Organisms need to constantly balance the competing demands of gathering information and using previously acquired information to obtain rewarding outcomes (i.e., the “exploration-exploitation” dilemma). Exploration is critical to obtain information to discover how the world works, which should be particularly important for young children. While studies have shown that young children explore in response to surprising events, little is known about how they balance exploration and exploitation across multiple decisions or about how this process changes with development. In this study we compare decision-making patterns of children and adults and evaluate the relative influences of reward-seeking, random exploration, and systematic switching (which approximates uncertainty-directed exploration). In a second experiment we directly test the effect of uncertainty on children’s choices. Influential models of decision-making generally describe systematic exploration as a computationally refined capacity that relies on top-down cognitive control. We demonstrate that (1) systematic patterns dominate young children’s behavior (facilitating exploration), despite protracted development of cognitive control, and (2) that uncertainty plays a major, but complicated, role in determining children’s choices. We conclude that while young children’s immature top-down control should hinder adult-like systematic exploration, other mechanisms may pick up the slack, facilitating broad information gathering in a systematic fashion to build a foundation of knowledge for use later in life.},

In this review, we consider the structure of opponency in terms of previous biases about the nature of the decision problems that animals face, the conflicts that may thus arise between Pavlovian and instrumental responses, and an additional spectrum joining invigoration to inhibition.

  abstract = {Background: The concept of vulnerability has held a central place in research ethics guidance since its introduction in the United States Belmont Report in 1979. It signals mindfulness for researchers and research ethics boards to the possibility that some participants may be at higher risk of harm or wrong. Despite its important intended purpose and widespread use, there is considerable disagreement in the scholarly literature about the meaning and delineation of vulnerability, stemming from a perceived lack of guidance within research ethics standards. The aim of this study was to assess the concept of vulnerability as it is employed in major national and international research ethics policies and guidelines. Methods: We conducted an in-depth analysis of 11 (five national and six international) research ethics policies and guidelines, exploring their discussions of the definition, application, normative justification and implications of vulnerability. Results: Few policies and guidelines explicitly defined vulnerability, instead relying on implicit assumptions and the delineation of vulnerable groups and sources of vulnerability. On the whole, we found considerable richness in the content on vulnerability across policies, but note that this relies heavily on the structure imposed on the data through our analysis. Conclusions: Our results underscore a need for policymakers to revisit the guidance on vulnerability in research ethics, and we propose that a process of stakeholder engagement would well-support this effort.},

These neurons are known to be active during motivated behavior, but the underlying principles that govern their activity are unknown. Here we show that a group of dorsal raphe neurons encode behavioral tasks in a systematic manner, tracking progress toward upcoming rewards. We analyzed dorsal raphe neuron activity recorded while animals performed two reward-oriented saccade tasks. There was a strong correlation between the tonic activity level of a neuron during behavioral tasks and its encoding of reward-related cues and outcomes. Neurons that were tonically excited during the task predominantly carried positive reward signals. Neurons that were tonically inhibited during the task predominantly carried negative reward signals. Neurons that did not change their tonic activity levels during the task had weak reward signals with no tendency for a positive or negative direction. This form of correlated task and reward coding accounted for the majority of systematic variation in dorsal raphe response patterns in our tasks. A smaller component of neural activity reflected detection of reward delivery. Our data suggest that the dorsal raphe nucleus encodes participation in a behavioral task in terms of its future motivational outcomes.},

  abstract = {The serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor is the primary molecular target of serotonergic hallucinogens, which trigger large-scale perturbations of the cortex. Our understanding of how 5-HT2A activation may cause the effects of hallucinogens has been hampered by the receptor unselectivity of most of the drugs of this class. Here we used 25CN-NBOH (N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenylethylamine), a newly developed selective 5-HT2A agonist, and tested it with regard to the head-twitch-response (HTR) model of 5-HT2A activity and effects on locomotion. 25CN-NBOH evoked HTRs with an inverted u-shape-like dose-response curve and highest efficacy at 1.5 mg/kg, i.p. HTR occurrence peaked within 5 min after agonist injection, and exponentially decreased to half-maximal frequency at \textasciitilde 11 min. Thorough habituation to the experimental procedures (including handling, saline injection, and exposure to the observational boxes 1 day before the experiment) facilitated the animals' response to 25CN-NBOH. 25CN-NBOH (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced HTRs were blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (0.75 mg/kg, 30 min pre), but not by the 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min pre). SB-242084 instead slightly increased the number of HTRs occurring at a 3.0-mg/kg dose of the agonist. Apart from HTR induction, 25CN-NBOH also modestly increased locomotor activity of the mice. Repeated once-per-day injections (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to reduced occurrence of 25CN-NBOH induced HTRs. This intermediate tolerance was augmented when a second (higher) dose of the drug (3.0 mg/kg) was interspersed. Short-interval tolerance (i.e., tachyphylaxis) was observed when the drug was injected twice at intervals of 1.0 and 1.5 h at either dose tested (1.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively). Inducing ketanserin-sensitive HTRs, which are dependent on environmental valences and which show signs of tachyphylaxis and tolerance, 25CN-NBOH shares striking features common to serotonergic hallucinogens. Given its distinct in vitro selectivity for 5-HT2A over non5-HT2 receptors and its behavioral dynamics, 25CN-NBOH appears to be a powerful tool for dissection of receptor-specific cortical circuit dynamics, including 5-HT2A related psychoactivity.},

  abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) receptors are increasingly recognized as major targets for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence suggest a pathophysiological role for glutamate NMDA receptors in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and associated disorders in attention and executive functioning. We investigated how the interactions between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A and glutamate NMDA receptor mechanisms in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contribute to the control of different aspects of attentional performance. Rats were trained on a five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task, which provides indices of attentional functioning (percentage of correct responses), executive control (measured by anticipatory and perseverative responses), and speed. The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CPP (50\,ng/side) was infused directly into the mPFC 5\,min after infusion of either 8-OH-DPAT (30 and 100\,ng/side) or M100907 (100 and 300\,ng/side) into the same brain area. Impairments in attentional functioning induced by CPP were completely abolished by both doses of 8-OH-DPAT or M100907. In addition, M100907 abolished the CPP-induced anticipatory responding but had no effects on perseverative over-responding, while 8-OH-DPAT reduced the perseverative over-responding but had no effects on anticipatory responding induced by CPP. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (30\,ng/side) antagonized the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (100\,ng/side). 8-OH-DPAT at 30\,ng/side reduced the latency of correct responses in controls and CPP-injected rats and lowered the percentage of omissions in CPP-injected rats. The data show that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC exert opposing actions on attentional functioning and demonstrate a dissociable contribution of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC to different aspects of executive control such as impulsivity and compulsive perseveration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             One aspect of goal-directed behavior, which is known to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia (SZ), is balancing between exploiting a familiar choice with known reward value and exploring a lesser known, but potentially more rewarding option. Despite its relevance to several symptom domains of SZ, this has received little attention in SZ research. In addition, while there is increasing evidence that SZ is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, few studies have investigated how this relates to specific behaviors, such as balancing exploration and exploitation. We therefore assessed behaviors underlying the exploration–exploitation trade-off using a three-armed bandit task in 45 patients with SZ and 19 healthy controls (HC). This task allowed us to dissociate goal-unrelated (random) from goal-related (directed) exploration and correlate them with psychopathological symptoms. Moreover, we assessed a broad range of inflammatory proteins in the blood and related them to bandit task behavior. We found that, compared to HC, patients with SZ showed reduced task performance. This impairment was due to a shift from exploitation to random exploration, which was associated with symptoms of disorganization. Relative to HC, patients with SZ showed a pro-inflammatory blood profile. Furthermore, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) positively correlated with random exploration, but not with directed exploration or exploitation. In conclusion, we show that low-grade inflammation in patients with SZ is associated with random exploration, which can be considered a behavioral marker for disorganization. hsCRP may constitute a marker for severity of, and a potential treatment target for maladaptive exploratory behaviors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression, with up to 11.9\% prevalence in the general population, is a common disorder strongly associated with increased morbidity. The accuracy of non-psychiatric physicians in recognizing depression may influence the outcome of the illness, as unrecognized patients are not offered treatment for depression. OBJECTIVES To describe and quantitatively summarize the existing data on recognition of depression by non-psychiatric physicians. METHODS We searched the following databases: MEDLINE (1966–2005), Psych INFO (1967–2005) and CINAHL (1982–2005). To summarize data presented in the papers reviewed, we calculated the Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the summary sensitivity, specificity and odds ratios (ORs) of recognition, and their 95\% confidence intervals using the random effects model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The summary sensitivity, specificity, and OR of recognition using the random effects model were: 36.4\% (95\% CI: 27.9–44.8), 83.7\% (95\% CI: 77.5–90.0), and 4.0 (95\% CI: 3.2–4.9), respectively. We also calculated the Summary ROC. We performed a metaregression analysis, which showed that the method of documentation of recognition, the age of the sample, and the date of study publication have significant effect on the summary sensitivity and the odds of recognition, in the univariate model. Only the method of documentation had a significant effect on summary sensitivity, when the age of the sample and the date of publication were added to the model. CONCLUSION The accuracy of depression recognition by non-psychiatrist physicians is low. Further research should focus on developing standardized methods of documenting non-psychiatric physicians’ recognition of depression.},

Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue. Thirty-one healthy male participants performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design under three drug conditions: 150 mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2 mg of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. Choices were best explained by an extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, directed exploration and random exploration. Modeling revealed attenuated directed exploration under L-dopa, while neural signatures of exploration, exploitation and prediction error were unaffected. Instead, L-dopa attenuated neural representations of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that dopamine modulates how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during decision-making.},

  abstract = {Attentional states continuously reflect the predictability and uncertainty in one's environment having important consequences for learning and memory. Beyond well known cortical contributions, rapid shifts in attention are hypothesized to also originate from deep nuclei, such as the basal forebrain (BF) and locus coeruleus (LC) neuromodulatory systems. These systems are also the first to change with aging. Here we characterized the interplay between these systems and their regulation of afferent targets - the hippocampus (HPC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) - across the lifespan. To examine the role of attentional salience on task-dependent functional connectivity, we used a target-distractor go/no go task presented during functional MRI. In younger adults, BF coupling with the HPC, and LC coupling with the PCC, increased with behavioral relevance (targets vs distractors). Although the strength and presence of significant regional coupling changed in middle age, the most striking change in network connectivity was in old age, such that in older adults BF and LC coupling with their cortical afferents was largely absent and replaced by stronger interconnectivity between LC-BF nuclei. Overall rapid changes in attention related to behavioral relevance revealed distinct roles of subcortical neuromodulatory systems. The pronounced changes in functional network architecture across the lifespan suggest a decrease in these distinct roles, with deafferentation of cholinergic and noradrenergic systems associated with a shift towards mutual support during attention guided to external stimuli.},

It has theoretically been proposed that dopamine contributes to the control of this exploration-exploitation trade-off, specifically that the higher the level of tonic dopamine, the more exploitation is favored. We demonstrate here that there is a formal relationship between the rescaling of dopamine positive reward prediction errors and the exploration-exploitation trade-off in simple non-stationary multi-armed bandit tasks. We further show in rats performing such a task that systemically antagonizing dopamine receptors greatly increases the number of random choices without affecting learning capacities. Simulations and comparison of a set of different computational models (an extended Q-learning model, a directed exploration model, and a meta-learning model) fitted on each individual confirm that, independently of the model, decreasing dopaminergic activity does not affect learning rate but is equivalent to an increase in random exploration rate. This study shows that dopamine could adapt the exploration-exploitation trade-off in decision-making when facing changing environmental contingencies.},

In Study 1, there were cultural differences in the impact of conformity on U.S. and Ni-Vanuatu adults' judgments of children's intelligence and good behavior. When evaluating U.S. children only, U.S. adults were less likely to endorse high conformity children as intelligent, often citing creativity as a justification for their judgments. In contrast, Ni-Vanuatu adults were more likely to endorse Ni-Vanuatu high conformity children as intelligent. Ni-Vanuatu adults were also more likely to endorse high conformity children as well-behaved than U.S. adults. In Study 2, there were no effects of socioeconomic status on U.S. adults' evaluations of conformity. U.S. adults were less likely to endorse high conformity children as intelligent than Ni-Vanuatu adults. Taken together, the data demonstrate that beliefs about the relations between intelligence, conformity, and creativity vary within and across cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  abstract = {The role of serotonin in human behaviour is critically informed by approaches which allow in vivo modification of synaptic serotonin. However, characterising the effects of increased serotonin signalling in human models of behaviour is challenging given the limitations of available experimental probes (e.g., SSRIs). Here we use a now accessible approach to directly increase synaptic serotonin in humans - a selective serotonin releasing agent - and examine its influence on domains of behaviour historically considered core functions of serotonin. Computational techniques including reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling were fit to observed behaviour. Reinforcement learning models revealed that increased synaptic serotonin reduced sensitivity specifically for outcomes in aversive but not appetitive contexts. Furthermore, increasing synaptic serotonin enhanced behavioural inhibition, and shifted bias towards impulse control during exposure to aversive emotional probes. These effects were seen in the context of overall improvements in memory for neutral verbal information. Our findings highlight the direct effects of increased synaptic serotonin on human behaviour, underlining its critical role in guiding decision-making within aversive and neutral contexts, and offering broad implications for longstanding theories of central serotonin function.},

  abstract = {The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and in particular in the case of underpowered studies has introduced doubts on our ability to reproduce, replicate and generalize findings. As a response, we have seen the emergence of suggested guidelines and principles for neuroscientists known as Good Scientific Practice for conducting more reliable research. Still, every study remains almost unique in its combination of analytical and statistical approaches. While it is understandable considering the diversity of designs and brain data recording, it also represents a striking point against reproducibility. Here, we propose a non-parametric permutation-based statistical framework, primarily designed for neurophysiological data, in order to perform group-level inferences on non-negative measures of information encompassing metrics from information-theory, machine-learning or measures of distances. The framework supports both fixed- and random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions variability. Using numerical simulations, we compared the accuracy in ground-truth retrieving of both group models, such as test- and cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons. We then reproduced and extended existing results using both spatially uniform MEG and non-uniform intracranial neurophysiological data. We showed how the framework can be used to extract stereotypical task- and behavior-related effects across the population covering scales from the local level of brain regions, inter-areal functional connectivity to measures summarizing network properties. We also present an open-source Python toolbox called Frites1 that includes the proposed statistical pipeline using information-theoretic metrics such as single-trial functional connectivity estimations for the extraction of cognitive brain networks. Taken together, we believe that this framework deserves careful attention as its robustness and flexibility could be the starting point toward the uniformization of statistical approaches.},

  abstract = {A core goal in systems neuroscience and neuroethology is to understand how neural circuits generate naturalistic behavior. One foundational idea is that complex naturalistic behavior may be composed of sequences of stereotyped behavioral syllables, which combine to generate rich sequences of actions. To investigate this, a common approach is to use autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) to segment video into discrete behavioral syllables. While these approaches have been successful in extracting syllables that are interpretable, they fail to account for other forms of behavioral variability, such as differences in speed, which may be better described as continuous in nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a class of warped ARHMMs (WARHMM). As is the case in the ARHMM, behavior is modeled as a mixture of autoregressive dynamics. However, the dynamics under each discrete latent state (i.e. each behavioral syllable) are additionally modulated by a continuous latent “warping variable.” We present two versions of warped ARHMM in which the warping variable affects the dynamics of each syllable either linearly or nonlinearly. Using depth-camera recordings of freely moving mice, we demonstrate that the failure of ARHMMs to account for continuous behavioral variability results in duplicate cluster assignments. WARHMM achieves similar performance to the standard ARHMM while using fewer behavioral syllables. Further analysis of behavioral measurements in mice demonstrates that WARHMM identifies structure relating to response vigor.},

We systematically varied the rewards associated with choice options, the rate by which rewards decreased over time, and the opportunity costs it took to switch to the next option to disentangle the contributions of dopamine and noradrenaline to specific choice aspects. Our data show that amisulpride increased the sensitivity to all of these three critical choice features, whereas propranolol was associated with a reduced tendency to use value information. Our findings provide novel insights into the specific roles of dopamine and noradrenaline in the regulation of human choice behavior, suggesting a critical involvement of dopamine in directed exploration and a role of noradrenaline in more random exploration.},

While there is growing evidence that psilocybin exerts its beneficial effects through enhancing neural plasticity, the exact brain regions involved are not completely understood. Determining the impact of psilocybin on plasticity-related gene expression throughout the brain can broaden our understanding of the neural circuits involved in psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity. In this study, whole-brain serial two-photon microscopy and light sheet microscopy were employed to map the expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, in male and female mice. The druginduced c-Fos expression following psilocybin administration was compared to that of subanesthetic ketamine and saline control. Psilocybin and ketamine produced acutely comparable elevations in c-Fos expression in numerous brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, locus coeruleus, primary visual cortex, central and basolateral amygdala, medial and lateral habenula, and claustrum. Select regions exhibited drug-preferential differences, such as dorsal raphe and insular cortex for psilocybin and the CA1 subfield of hippocampus for ketamine. To gain insights into the contributions of receptors and cell types, the c-Fos expression maps were related to brain-wide in situ hybridization data. The transcript analyses showed that the endogenous levels of Grin2a and Grin2b predict whether a cortical region is sensitive to drug-evoked neural plasticity for both ketamine and psilocybin. Collectively, the systematic mapping approach produced an unbiased list of brain regions impacted by psilocybin and ketamine. The data are a resource that highlights previously underappreciated regions for future investigations. Furthermore, the robust relationships between drug-evoked c-Fos expression and endogenous transcript distributions suggest glutamatergic receptors as a potential convergent target for how psilocybin and ketamine produce their rapid-acting and long-lasting therapeutic effects.},

  abstract = {N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic compound identified endogenously in mammals, is biosynthesized by aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT). Whether DMT is biosynthesized in the mammalian brain is unknown. We investigated brain expression of INMT transcript in rats and humans, co-expression of INMT and AADC mRNA in rat brain and periphery, and brain concentrations of DMT in rats. INMT transcripts were identified in the cerebral cortex, pineal gland, and choroid plexus of both rats and humans via in situ hybridization. Notably, INMT mRNA was colocalized with AADC transcript in rat brain tissues, in contrast to rat peripheral tissues where there existed little overlapping expression of INMT with AADC transcripts. Additionally, extracellular concentrations of DMT in the cerebral cortex of normal behaving rats, with or without the pineal gland, were similar to those of canonical monoamine neurotransmitters including serotonin. A significant increase of DMT levels in the rat visual cortex was observed following induction of experimental cardiac arrest, a finding independent of an intact pineal gland. These results show for the first time that the~rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT at concentrations comparable to known monoamine neurotransmitters and raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        The serotonergic system plays important roles in both physiological and pathological processes, and is a widely used therapeutic target for many psychiatric disorders. Although several genetically encoded GFP-based serotonin (5-HT) sensors were recently developed, their sensitivities and spectral profiles are relatively limited. To overcome these limitations, we optimized green fluorescent G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-activation-based 5-HT (GRAB             5-HT             ) sensors and developed a new red fluorescent GRAB             5-HT             sensor. These sensors have excellent cell surface trafficking, high specificity, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution, making them suitable for monitoring 5-HT dynamics             in vivo             . Besides recording subcortical 5-HT release in freely moving mice, we observed both uniform and gradient 5-HT release in the mouse dorsal cortex with mesoscopic imaging. Finally, we performed dual-color imaging and observed seizure-induced waves of 5-HT release throughout the cortex following calcium and endocannabinoid waves. In summary, these 5-HT sensors can offer valuable insights regarding the serotonergic system in both physiological and pathological states.},

Given known limitations in human cognitive resources, we hypothesised the presence of additional cheaper strategies. We examined for such heuristics in choice behaviour where we show this involves a value-free random exploration, that ignores all prior knowledge, and a novelty exploration that targets novel options alone. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study, assessing contributions of dopamine (400 mg amisulpride) and noradrenaline (40 mg propranolol), we show that value-free random exploration is attenuated under the influence of propranolol, but not under amisulpride. Our findings demonstrate that humans deploy distinct computationally cheap exploration strategies and that value-free random exploration is under noradrenergic control.},

Its construction in hierarchical order permits the progressive assessment of the suicidal risk, in the form of a semi-structured interview. Hence, the suicidal risk assessment scale RSD looks for the existence of death wishes (levels 1-2), of suicide ideations and its frequency (levels 3-4-5), and of a passive desire to die (level 6). Level 7 shows the onset of a decision making process, except that the patient is still inhibited by various important factors in his/her life. More often, the fear of inflicting immense suffering to his/her loved ones or for religious beliefs, is found. From level 8, determination has made way to hesitation.

In this multicentre study, patients of both sexes were included, aged between 18 and 70 years, presenting a major depressive episode with a MADRS equal to a minimum of 25, and having had a minimum of two episodes of major depression within the last five years. RESULTS: The resulting analysis carried out on 103 patients showed a satisfactory concurrent validity between the suicidal risk assessment scale RSD and the items "suicide" of the MADRS (rho=0.79; p=0.0001) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (rho=0.70; p=0.0001), and fairly satisfactory concurrent validity with the depression degree assessed by the MADRS overall score (rho=0.40; p=0.0001). The short-term follow-up under treatment revealed enhanced sensitivity of the RSD versus the MADRS. The improvement in suicidal risk, assessed by the RSD, was faster than the improvement in depression, which is interesting from a clinical point of view. The medium-term follow-up tested the predictive validity of RSD and confirmed a greater level of suicidal risk from a score of 7 on the RSD, with the death by suicide of 2 subjects among the 15 who exhibited a score between 7 and 10 on the RSD on inclusion. On the other hand, no acting out, no attempted suicides, and no suicides were noted in the group of 88 subjects whose RSD was lower or equal to 6 on inclusion (p=0.02 using Fisher's exact test).

  abstract = {Neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca2+ imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures, and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant - the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multi-site two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.},

  abstract = {The prefrontal cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation that plays an important role in its regulation. However, how serotonin regulates different pyramidal and interneuron cell classes in this area is incompletely understood. Previous work in rats has shown that serotonin differentially regulates two classes of pyramidal cells in layer 5. It excites one class by activating 5-HT2A receptors, whereas it more subtly modulates the integrative properties of the other by co-activating 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Here we have used electrophysiological recordings, combined with retrograde labeling and morphological reconstruction, to show that the first cell class corresponds to long range corticofugal neurons and the second corresponds to intratelencephalic neurons. These results suggest that, in rats, serotonin facilitates subcortical output while more subtly modulating cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal output. Interestingly, these results obtained in rats differ from those previously reported for mouse prefrontal cortex. Therefore we reinvestigated the effects of serotonin in mice and confirmed that serotonin predominantly activates inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors on long-range corticofugal cells. Thus serotonin exerts opposite effects on these cells in rats and mice. Finally, we determined whether cortical serotonin responsiveness in mice is regulated during development. Serotonin elicited predominantly depolarizing inward current responses during the early postnatal period, whereas inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses did not become evident until the end of the second postnatal week. These results reveal commonalities as well as unexpected differences in the serotonergic regulation of long-range corticofugal and intratelencephalic neurons of layer 5 in rat and mouse.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Growing evidence suggests that behavioral variability plays a critical role in how humans manage the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. In these decisions a little variability can help us to overcome the desire to exploit known rewards by encouraging us to randomly explore something else. Here we investigate how such ‘random exploration’ could be controlled using a drift-diffusion model of the explore–exploit choice. In this model, variability is controlled by either the signal-to-noise ratio with which reward is encoded (the ‘drift rate’), or the amount of information required before a decision is made (the ‘threshold’). By fitting this model to behavior, we find that while, statistically, both drift and threshold change when people randomly explore, numerically, the change in drift rate has by far the largest effect. This suggests that random exploration is primarily driven by changes in the signal-to-noise ratio with which reward information is represented in the brain.},

To examine this, we made use of a well-established crosscultural difference in behavior: American culture tends to reinforce dominant behavior whereas, conversely, Japanese culture tends to reinforce subordinate behavior. In 17 Americans and 17 Japanese individuals, we assessed behavioral tendencies towards dominance versus subordination and measured neural responses using fMRI during the passive viewing of stimuli related to dominance and subordination. In Americans, dominant stimuli selectively engaged the caudate nucleus, bilaterally, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas these were selectively engaged by subordinate stimuli in Japanese. Correspondingly, Americans self-reported a tendency towards more dominant behavior whereas Japanese self-reported a tendency towards more subordinate behavior. Moreover, activity in the right caudate and mPFC correlated with behavioral tendencies towards dominance versus subordination, such that stronger responses in the caudate and mPFC to dominant stimuli were associated with more dominant behavior and stronger responses in the caudate and mPFC to subordinate stimuli were associated with more subordinate behavior. The findings provide a first demonstration that culture can flexibly shape functional activity in the mesolimbic reward system, which in turn may guide behavior.},

Methods:~           Participants were members of the 1970 British Cohort Study, a national birth cohort. At age 10, 11,563 children took tests to measure locus of control and IQ. At age 30, 7551 men and women (65\%) were interviewed about their health and completed a questionnaire about psychiatric morbidity.           Results:~           Men and women with a more internal locus of control score in childhood had a reduced risk of obesity (odds ratio, 95\% CI, for a SD increase in locus of control, 0.86, 0.78–0.95), overweight (0.87, 0.82–0.93), fair or poor self-rated health (0.89, 0.81–0.97), and psychological distress (0.86, 0.76–0.95). Women with a more internal locus of control had a reduced risk of high blood pressure (0.84, 0.76–0.92). Associations between childhood IQ and risk of obesity and overweight were weakened by adjustment for internal locus of control.           Conclusion:~           Having a stronger sense of control over one’s own life in childhood seems to be a protective factor for some aspects of health in adult life. Sense of control provides predictive power beyond contemporaneously assessed IQ and may partially mediate the association between higher IQ in childhood and later risk of obesity and overweight.

  abstract = {In order to maximize long-term rewards, agents must balance exploitation (choosing the option with the highest payoff) and exploration (gathering information about options that might have higher payoffs). Although the optimal solution to this trade-off is intractable, humans make use of two effective strategies: selectively exploring options with high uncertainty (directed exploration), and increasing the randomness of their choices when they are more uncertain (random exploration). Using a task that independently manipulates these two forms of exploration, we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms related to dopamine are associated with individual differences in exploration strategies. Variation in a gene linked to prefrontal dopamine (COMT) predicted the degree of directed exploration, as well as the overall randomness of responding. Variation in a gene linked to striatal dopamine (DARPP-32) predicted the degree of both directed and random exploration. These findings suggest that dopamine makes multiple contributions to exploration, depending on its afferent target.},

  abstract = {In order to discover the most rewarding actions, agents must collect information about their environment, potentially foregoing reward. The optimal solution to this “explore-exploit” dilemma is often computationally challenging, but principled algorithmic approximations exist. These approximations utilize uncertainty about action values in different ways. Some random exploration algorithms scale the level of choice stochasticity with the level of uncertainty. Other directed exploration algorithms add a “bonus” to action values with high uncertainty. Random exploration algorithms are sensitive to total uncertainty across actions, whereas directed exploration algorithms are sensitive to relative uncertainty. This paper reports a multi-armed bandit experiment in which total and relative uncertainty were orthogonally manipulated. We found that humans employ both exploration strategies, and that these strategies are independently controlled by different uncertainty computations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic compound that is showing promise in the ability to treat neurological conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. There have been several investigations into the neural correlates of psilocybin administration using non-invasive methods, however, there has yet to be an invasive study of the mechanism of action in awake rodents. Using multi-unit extracellular recordings, we recorded local field potential and spiking activity from populations of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of awake mice during the administration of psilocybin (2~mg/kg). The power of low frequency bands in the local field potential was found to significantly decrease in response to psilocybin administration, whilst gamma band activity trended towards an increase. The population firing rate was found to increase overall, with just under half of individual neurons showing a significant increase. Psilocybin significantly decreased the level of phase modulation of cells with each neural frequency band~except high-gamma oscillations, consistent with a desynchronization of cortical populations. Furthermore, bursting behavior was altered in a subset of cells, with both positive and negative changes in the rate of bursting. Neurons that increased their burst firing following psilocybin administration were highly likely to transition from a phase-modulated to a phase unmodulated state. Taken together, psilocybin reduces low frequency oscillatory power, increases overall firing rates and desynchronizes local neural activity. These findings are consistent with dissolution of the default mode network under psilocybin, and may be indicative of disruption of top-down processing in the acute psychedelic state.},

Learning about the consequences of actions should be slow in stable environments, but accelerate when that environment changes. Recognizing stability and detecting change are difficult in environments with noisy relationships between actions and outcomes. Under these conditions, theories propose that uncertainty can be used to modulate learning rates (‘‘metalearning’’). We show that mice behaving in a dynamic foraging task exhibit choice behavior that varied as a function of two forms of uncertainty estimated from a meta-learning model. The activity of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons tracked both types of uncertainty in the foraging task as well as in a dynamic Pavlovian task. Reversible inhibition of serotonin neurons in the foraging task reproduced changes in learning predicted by a simulated lesion of meta-learning in the model. We thus provide a quantitative link between serotonin neuron activity, learning, and decision making.},

  abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a circuit disorder involving corticostriatal projections, which play a role in motor control. The Sapap3-knockout (KO) mouse is a mouse model to study OCD and recapitulates OCD-like compulsion through excessive grooming behavior, with skin lesions appearing at advanced age. Deficits in corticostriatal control provide a link to the pathophysiology of OCD. However, there remain significant gaps in the characterization of the Sapap3-KO mouse, with respect to age, specificity of synaptic dysfunction, and locomotor phenotype. We therefore investigated the corticostriatal synaptic phenotype of Sapap3-KO mice using patch–clamp slice electrophysiology, in adult mice and with projection specificity. We also analyzed grooming across age and locomotor phenotype with a novel, unsupervised machine learning technique (MoSeq). Increased grooming in Sapap3-KO mice without skin lesions was age independent. Synaptic deficits persisted in adulthood and involved the projections from the motor cortices and cingulate cortex to the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum. Decreased synaptic strength was evident at the input from the primary motor cortex by reduction in AMPA receptor function. Hypolocomotion, i.e., slowness of movement, was consistently observed in Sapap3-KO mice. Our findings emphasize the utility of young adult Sapap3-KO mice to investigate corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction in motor control.},

The extent to which smooth muscle-covered arterioles or pericyte-covered capillaries control vasomotion during neurovascular coupling remains controversial. We found that capillary pericytes in mice and humans do not express smooth muscle actin and are morphologically and functionally distinct from adjacent precapillary smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Using optical imaging we investigated blood flow regulation at various sites on the vascular tree in living mice. Optogenetic, whisker stimulation, or cortical spreading depolarization caused microvascular diameter or flow changes in SMC but not pericyte-covered microvessels. During early stages of brain ischemia, transient SMC but not pericyte constrictions were a~major cause of hypoperfusion leading to thrombosis and distal microvascular occlusions. Thus, capillary pericytes are not contractile, and regulation of cerebral blood flow in physiological and pathological conditions is mediated by arteriolar SMCs.},

  abstract = {The remarkable effects exhibited by classical psychedelics in recent clinical trials have spawned considerable interest in 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation as a treatment strategy for several psychiatric/cognitive disorders. In this study we have continued our development of 25CN-NBOH, one of the most 5-HT2AR-selective agonists reported to date, as a pharmacological tool for exploration of 5-HT2AR expression and functions. The importance of the 2′ and 3′ positions in 25CN-NBOH as structural hotspots for its 5-HT2AR activity was investigated by synthesis and pharmacological characterization of six novel analogs at 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR in binding and functional assays. While the 5-HT2AR activity of 25CN-NBOH was retained in 3′-methyl, 2′,3′-chroman, 2′,3′-dihydrofuran and 2′,3′-furan analogs, the 3′-methoxy and 3′-ethyl analogs displayed substantially lower binding affinities and agonist potencies than 25CN-NBOH. Interestingly, the 2′,3′-substitution pattern was also a key determinant of agonist efficacy, as all six analogs exhibited low-efficacy partial agonism or de facto antagonism at the 5-HT2AR in the functional assays. Systemic administration of 25CN-NBOH and its close structural analog 25CN-NBMD induced robust head-twitch response in mice, a well-established behavioural effect of 5-HT2AR activation in vivo, and 25CN-NBOH mediated robust reductions in the activity of mice in an anxiety-related marble burying assay, which supports the proposed beneficial effects of 5-HT2AR activation on disorders characterized by cognitive rigidity. Finally, tritiated 25CN-NBOH exhibited high 5-HT2AR binding affinity (KD \textasciitilde 1~nM) and selectivity against 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR in equilibrium and kinetic binding studies of the recombinant receptors, and in concordance [3H]25CN-NBOH displayed substantial specific, ketanserin-sensitive binding to cortex and small levels of binding to choroid plexus in rat brain slices in autoradiography studies. In conclusion, this work delineates the subtle molecular determinants of the 5-HT2AR activity in 25CN-NBOH, substantiates the potential in this compound and its analogs as tools for in vivo studies of the 5-HT2AR, and introduces a novel selective agonist radioligand as another potentially valuable tool for future explorations of this receptor.},

According to the adaptive gain theory, the LC–NE system is critical for optimizing behavioral performance by regulating the balance between exploitative and exploratory control states. However, crucial direct empirical tests of this theory in human subjects have been lacking. We used a pharmacological manipulation of the LC–NE system to test predictions of this theory in humans. In a double-blind parallel-groups design (N\,=\,52), participants received 4\,mg reboxetine (a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), 30\,mg citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), or placebo. The adaptive gain theory predicted that the increased tonic NE levels induced by reboxetine would promote task disengagement and exploratory behavior. We assessed the effects of reboxetine on performance in two cognitive tasks designed to examine task (dis)engagement and exploitative versus exploratory behavior: a diminishing-utility task and a gambling task with a non-stationary pay-off structure. In contrast to predictions of the adaptive gain theory, we did not find differences in task (dis)engagement or exploratory behavior between the three experimental groups, despite demonstrable effects of the two drugs on non-specific central and autonomic nervous system parameters. Our findings suggest that the LC–NE system may not be involved in the regulation of the exploration–exploitation trade-off in humans, at least not within the context of a single task. It remains to be examined whether the LC–NE system is involved in random exploration exceeding the current task context.},

A mirror-face-recognition task and a mirror-leg-recognition task were conducted at 18 months. A video-face-recognition task and a mirror-leg-recognition task were conducted at 26 months. Results revealed no predictive relationships between infants' contingency preference and detection in the first year of life and their ability to recognize themselves in a mirror or on a video monitor in the second and third year of life. This finding supports the notion that self-recognition emerges independently from the experience of contingencies (Bischof-Köhler, 1991, 2012).

Eighty-nine participants performed the two-choice probabilistic learning task while their pupil size and response time were continuously recorded. Using LMM analysis, we estimated differences in the pupil size and response time between the advantageous and disadvantageous choices as a function of learning success, i.e., whether or not a participant has learned the probabilistic contingency between choices and their outcomes. We proposed that before a true value of each choice became known to a decision-maker, both advantageous and disadvantageous choices represented a random exploration of the two options with an equally uncertain outcome, whereas the same choices after learning manifested exploitation and direct exploration strategies, respectively. We found that disadvantageous choices were associated with increases both in response time and pupil size, but only after the participants had learned the choice-reward contingencies. For the pupil size, this effect was strongly amplified for those disadvantageous choices that immediately followed gains as compared to losses in the preceding choice. Pupil size modulations were evident during the behavioral choice rather than during the pretrial baseline. These findings suggest that occasional disadvantageous choices, which violate the acquired internal utility model, represent directed exploration. This exploratory strategy shifts choice priorities in favor of information seeking and its autonomic and behavioral concomitants are mainly driven by the conflict between the behavioral plan of the intended exploratory choice and its strong alternative, which has already proven to be more rewarding.},

Human neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for a hierarchical sensorimotor-to-association (S–A) axis of cortical neurodevelopment. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie this program of development using traditional neuroimaging approaches has been challenging. Animal models have been used to identify periods of enhanced experience-dependent plasticity – 'critical periods' – that progress along cortical hierarchies and are governed by a conserved set of neurobiological mechanisms that promote and then restrict plasticity. In this review we hypothesize that the S–A axis of cortical development in humans is partly driven by the cascading maturation of critical period plasticity mechanisms.

  abstract = {An important problem in time-series analysis is modeling systems with timevarying dynamics. Probabilistic models with joint continuous and discrete latent states offer interpretable, efficient, and experimentally useful descriptions of such data. Commonly used models include autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. ARHMMs permit exact inference and easy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long dependencies, and hence are prone to overfitting. In contrast, SLDSs can capture long-range dependencies in a parameter efficient way through Markovian latent dynamics, but present an intractable likelihood and a challenging parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose switching autoregressive low-rank tensor (SALT) models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses. SALT parameterizes the tensor of an ARHMM with a low-rank factorization to control the number of parameters and allow longer range dependencies without overfitting. We prove theoretical and discuss practical connections between SALT, linear dynamical systems, and SLDSs. We empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets. Furthermore, the learned low-rank tensor provides novel insights into temporal dependencies within each discrete state.},

  abstract = {It has been known for several decades that serotonergic neurotransmission is a key regulator of cognitive function, mood, and sleep. Yet with the relatively recent discoveries of novel serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes, as well as an expanding knowledge of their expression level in certain brain regions and localization on certain cell types, their involvement in cognitive processes is still emerging. Of particular interest are cognitive processes impacted in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical to normal cognitive processes, including attention, impulsivity, planning, decision-making, working memory, and learning or recall of learned memories. Furthermore, serotonergic dysregulation within the PFC is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders associated with prominent symptoms of cognitive dysfunction. Thus, it is important to better understand the overall makeup of serotonergic receptors in the PFC and on which cell types these receptors mediate their actions. In this Review, we focus on 5-HT receptor expression patterns within the PFC and how they influence cognitive behavior and neurotransmission. We further discuss the net effects of vortioxetine, an antidepressant acting through multiple serotonergic targets given the recent findings that vortioxetine improves cognition by modulating multiple neurotransmitter systems.},

  abstract = {Background. Pathological gambling (PG) is an impulse control disorder characterized by excessive monetary risk seeking in the face of negative consequences. We used tools from the field of behavioral economics to refine our description of risk-taking behavior in pathological gamblers. This theoretical framework allowed us to confront two hypotheses : (1) pathological gamblers distort winning probabilities more than controls ; and (2) pathological gamblers merely overweight the whole probability range. Method. Eighteen pathological gamblers and 20 matched healthy participants performed a decision-making task involving choices between safe amounts of money and risky gambles. The online adjustment of safe amounts, depending on participants’ decisions, allowed us to compute ‘ certainty equivalents ’ reflecting the subjective probability weight associated with each gamble. The behavioral data were then fitted with a mathematical function known as the ‘ probability weighting function ’, allowing us to disentangle our two hypotheses. Results. The results favored the second hypothesis, suggesting that pathological gamblers’ behavior reflects economic preferences globally shifted towards risk, rather than excessively distorted probability weighting. A mathematical parameter (elevation parameter) estimated by our fitting procedure was found to correlate with gambling severity among pathological gamblers, and with gambling affinity among controls. Conclusions. PG is associated with a specific pattern of economic preferences, characterized by a global (i.e. probability independent) shift towards risky options. The observed correlation with gambling severity suggests that the present ‘ certainty equivalent ’ task may be relevant for clinical use.},

Several reinforcement-learning (RL) models were recently proposed to refine the qualitative and quantitative inferences that can be made about these processes based on IGT data. Yet, these models do not account for the complex exploratory patterns which characterize participants' behavior in the task. Using a dataset of more than 500 subjects, we demonstrate the existence of sequential exploration in the IGT and we describe a new computational architecture disentangling exploitation, random exploration and sequential exploration in this large population of participants. The new Value plus Sequential Exploration (VSE) architecture provided a better fit than previous models. Parameter recovery, model recovery and simulation analyses confirmed the superiority of the VSE scheme. Furthermore, using the VSE model, we confirmed the existence of a significant reduction in directed exploration across lifespan in the IGT, as previously reported with other paradigms. Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily and flexibly fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients and contributing to the development of computational psychiatry.},

Two important open questions are whether the brain encodes absolute or relative value signals, and what role attention might play in these computations. We investigated these questions using a human fMRI experiment with a binary choice task in which the fixations to both stimuli were exogenously manipulated to control for the role of visual attention in the valuation computation. We found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum encoded fixation-dependent relative value signals: activity in these areas correlated with the difference in value between the attended and the unattended items. These attention-modulated relative value signals might serve as the input of a comparator system that is used to make a choice.},

  abstract = {Are young children just random explorers who learn serendipitously? Or are even young children guided by uncertainty-­directed sampling, seeking to explore in a systematic fashion? We study how children between the ages of 4 and 9 search in an explore–­exploit task with spatially correlated rewards, where exhaustive exploration is infeasible and not all options can be experienced. By combining behavioral data with a computational model that decomposes search into similarity-b­ ased generalization, uncertainty-­directed exploration, and random exploration, we map out developmental trajectories of generalization and exploration. The behavioral data show strong developmental differences in children's capability to exploit environmental structure, with performance and adaptiveness of sampling decisions increasing with age. Through model-b­ ased analyses, we disentangle different forms of exploration, finding signature of both uncertainty-­directed and random exploration. The amount of random exploration strongly decreases as children get older, supporting the notion of a developmental “cooling off” process that modulates the randomness in sampling. However, even at the youngest age range, children do not solely rely on random exploration. Even as random exploration begins to taper off, children are actively seeking out options with high uncertainty in a goal-­directed fashion, and using inductive inferences to generalize their experience to novel options. Our findings provide critical insights into the behavioral and computational principles underlying the developmental trajectory of learning and exploration.},

  abstract = {Serotonin is implicated in the valuation of aversive costs, such as delay or physical effort. However, its role in governing sensitivity to cognitive effort, for example, deliberation costs during information gathering, is unclear. We show that treatment with a serotonergic antidepressant in healthy human individuals of either sex enhances a willingness to gather information when trying to maximize reward. Using computational modeling, we show this arises from a diminished sensitivity to subjective deliberation costs during the sampling process. This result is consistent with the notion that serotonin alleviates sensitivity to aversive costs in a domain-general fashion, with implications for its potential contribution to a positive impact on motivational deficits in psychiatric disorders.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Gathering information about the world is essential for successfully navigating it. However, sampling information is costly, and we need to balance between gathering too little and too much information. The neurocomputational mechanisms underlying this arbitration between a putative gain, such as reward, and the associated costs, such as allocation of cognitive resources, remain unclear. In this study, we show that week-long daily treatment with a serotonergic antidepressant enhances a willingness to gather information when trying to maximize reward. Computational modeling indicates this arises from a reduced perception of aversive costs, rendering information gathering less cognitively effortful. This finding points to a candidate mechanism by which serotonergic treatment might help alleviate motivational deficits in a range of mental illnesses.},

L5 pyramidal neurons are grouped into two subclasses based on their projection targets; while intratelencephalic (IT) neurons project to cortical areas and the striatum, extratelencephalic (ET) neurons project to subcortical areas such as the thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem. Each L5 subclass possesses distinct morphological and electrophysiological properties and is incorporated into a unique synaptic network. Thanks to recent advances in genetic tools and methodologies, it has now become possible to distinguish between the two subclasses in the living brain. There is increasing evidence indicating that each subclass plays a unique role in sensory processing, decision-making, and learning. This review first summarizes the anatomical and physiological properties as well as the neuromodulation of IT and ET neurons in the rodent neocortex, and then reviews recent literature on their roles in sensory processing and rodent behavior. Our ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of each subclass in cortical function by examining their operational regimes based on their cellular properties.},

  abstract = {Behavioral flexibility and impulse control are necessary for successful execution of adaptive behavior. They are impaired in patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in some clinically important conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been investigated as a critical structure for behavioral flexibility and impulse control, the contribution of the underlying pyramidal neuron cell types in the mPFC remained to be understood. Here we show that interneuron-mediated local inactivation of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC of male and female mice induces both premature responses and choice bias, and establish that these impulsive and compulsive responses are modulated independently. Cell-type-specific photoinhibition of pyramidal deep layer corticostriatal or corticothalamic neurons reduces behavioral flexibility without inducing premature responses. Together, our data confirm the role of corticostriatal neurons in behavioral flexibility and demonstrate that flexible behaviors are also modulated by direct projections from deep layer corticothalamic neurons in the mPFC to midline thalamic nuclei., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Behavioral flexibility and impulse control are indispensable for animals to adapt to changes in the environment and often affected in patients with PFC damage and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We used a probabilistic reversal task to dissect the underlying neural circuitry in the mPFC. Through characterization of the three major pyramidal cell types in the mPFC with optogenetic silencing, we demonstrated that corticostriatal and corticothalamic but not corticocortical pyramidal neurons are temporally recruited for behavioral flexibility. Together, our findings confirm the role of corticostriatal projections in cognitive flexibility and identify corticothalamic neurons as equally important for behavioral flexibility.},

Most studies have examined its consequences, systems, and mechanisms in a static way, but attention is at the confluence of multiple sources of flux. The world advances, we operate within it, our minds change, and all resulting signals progress through multiple pathways within the dynamic networks of our brains. Our aim in this review is to raise awareness of and interest in three important facets of how timing impacts our understanding of attention. These include the challenges posed to attention by the timing of neural processing and psychological functions, the opportunities conferred to attention by various temporal structures in the environment, and how tracking the time courses of neural and behavioral modulations with continuous measures yields surprising insights into the workings and principles of attention.},

This diversity suggests that functionally heterogeneous subtypes of 5-HT neurons exist, but linking subsets of these neurons to particular functions has been technically challenging. We discuss recent data from molecular genetic, genomic and functional methods that, when coupled with classical findings, yield a reframing of the 5-HT neuronal system as a conglomeration of diverse subsystems with potential to inspire novel, more targeted therapies for clinically distinct 5-HT-related disorders.},

We begin by formalizing two forms of cost associated with a given level of performance: an intensity cost that quantifies how much information must be added to the input to achieve the desired response for a given task, that we treat as the contribution of control ; and an interaction cost that quantifies the degree to which performance is degraded as a result of interference between processes responsible for performing two or more tasks, that we treat as inversely related to automaticity. We develop a formal expression of the relationship between these two costs, and use this to derive the optimal control policy for a desired level of performance. We use that, in turn, to quantify the tradeoff between control and automaticity, and suggest how this can be used as a normative framework for understanding how people adjudicate between the benefits of control and automaticity.},

Analogously to their parent compounds and other classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), NBOMes are believed to exert their main pharmacological effects through activation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. Since their introduction as New Psychoactive Substances (NPSs) in 2010, NBOMes have been widely used for recreational purposes; this has resulted in numerous cases of acute toxicity, sometimes with lethal outcomes, leading to the classification of several NBOMes as Schedule I substances in 2013. However, in addition to their recreational use, the NBOMe class has yielded several important biochemical tools, including [11C]Cimbi-36, which is now being used in positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the mammalian brain, and 25CN-NBOH, one of the most selective 5-HT2A receptor agonists developed to date. In this Review, the history, chemistry, structure–activity relationships, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, and safety profiles of NBOMes will be outlined and discussed.},

  abstract = {Alterations of the serotonergic system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Although abnormal synchronous activity is observed in the PFC of these patients, little is known about the role of serotonin (5-HT) in cortical synchrony. We found that 5-HT, released by electrical stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in anesthetized rats, regulates the frequency and the amplitude of slow ({$<$}2 Hz) waves in the PFC via 5-HT               2A               receptors (5-HT               2A               Rs). 5-HT also modulates prefrontal gamma (30–80 Hz) rhythms through both 5-HT               1A               Rs and 5-HT               2A               Rs, but not 5-HT               2C               Rs, inducing an overall decrease in the amplitude of gamma oscillations. Because fast-spiking interneurons (FSi) are involved in the generation of gamma waves, we examined serotonergic modulation of FSi activity               in vivo               . Most FSi are inhibited by serotonin through 5-HT               1A               Rs, while a minority is activated by 5-HT               2A               Rs, and not 5-HT               2C               Rs.               In situ               hybridization histochemistry confirmed that distinct populations of FSi in the PFC express 5-HT               1A               Rs and 5-HT               2A               Rs, and that the number of FSi expressing 5-HT               2C               Rs is negligible. We conclude that 5-HT exerts a potent control on slow and gamma oscillations in the PFC. On the one hand, it shapes the frequency and amplitude of slow waves through 5-HT               2A               Rs. On the other hand, it finely tunes the amplitude of gamma oscillations through 5-HT               2A               R- and 5-HT               1A               R-expressing FSi, although it primarily downregulates gamma waves via the latter population. These results may provide insight into impaired serotonergic control of network activity in psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of environmental controllability enables individuals to adaptively adjust their behavior—exploiting rewards when desirable outcomes are contingent upon their actions and minimizing costly deliberation when their actions are inconsequential. However, it remains unclear how estimation of environmental controllability changes from childhood to adulthood. Ninety participants (ages 8–25) completed a task that covertly alternated between controllable and uncontrollable conditions, requiring them to explore different actions to discover the current degree of environmental controllability. We found that while children were able to distinguish controllable and uncontrollable conditions, accuracy of controllability assessments improved with age. Computational modeling revealed that whereas younger participants’ controllability assessments relied on evidence gleaned through random exploration, older participants more effectively recruited their task structure knowledge to make highly informative interventions. Age-related improvements in working memory mediated this qualitative shift toward increased use of an inferential strategy. Collectively, these findings reveal an age-related shift in the cognitive processes engaged to assess environmental controllability. Improved detection of environmental controllability may foster increasingly adaptive behavior over development by revealing when actions can be leveraged for one’s benefit.},

To address this issue, we recorded from neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in rats performing an odor-guided spatial decision task. A large fraction of DRN neurons showed transient firing time locked to behavioral events on timescales as little as 20 ms. DRN transients were sometimes correlated with reward parameters, but also encoded specific sensorimotor events, including stimulus identity and response direction. These behavioral correlates were diverse but showed no apparent relationship with waveform or other firing properties indicative of neurochemical identity. These results suggest that the 5-HT system does not encode a unitary signal and that it will broadcast specific information to the forebrain with speed and precision sufficient not only to modulate but also to dynamically sculpt ongoing information processing.},

Human studies implicate a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene in increased susceptibility to depression and decreased treatment response. Here we develop a new strategy to manipulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors in raphe nuclei without affecting 5-HT1A heteroreceptors, generating mice with higher (1A-High) or lower (1A-Low) autoreceptor levels. We show that this robustly affects raphe firing rates, but has no effect on either basal forebrain serotonin levels or conflict-anxiety measures. However, compared to 1A-Low mice, 1A-High mice show a blunted physiological response to acute stress, increased behavioral despair, and no behavioral response to antidepressant, modeling patients with the 5-HT1A risk allele. Furthermore, reducing 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels prior to antidepressant treatment is sufficient to convert nonresponders into responders. These results establish a causal relationship between 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels, resilience under stress, and response to antidepressants.},

  abstract = {People with Methamphetamine Use Disorder (PwMUD) spend substantial time and resources on substance use, which hinders their ability to explore alternate reinforcers. Gold-standard behavioural treatments attempt to remedy this by encouraging action towards non-drug reinforcers, but substance use often persists. We aimed to unravel the mechanistic drivers of this behaviour by applying a computational model of explore/exploit behaviour to decision-making data (Iowa Gambling Task) from 106 PwMUD and 48 controls. We then examined the longitudinal link between explore/exploit mechanisms and changes in methamphetamine use 6 weeks later. Exploitation parameters included reinforcement sensitivity and inverse decay (i.e., number of past outcomes used to guide choices). Exploration parameters included maximum directed exploration value (i.e., value of trying novel actions). The Timeline Follow Back measured changes in methamphetamine use. Compared to controls, PwMUD showed deficits in exploitative decision-making, characterised by reduced reinforcement sensitivity, U = 3065, p = 0.009, and less use of previous choice outcomes, U = 3062, p = 0.010. This was accompanied by a behavioural pattern of frequent shifting between choices, which appeared consistent with random exploration. Furthermore, PwMUD with greater reductions of methamphetamine use at 6 weeks had increased directed exploration (β = 0.22, p = 0.045); greater use of past choice outcomes (β = À0.39, p = 0.002) and greater choice consistency (β = À0.39, p = 0.002). Therefore, limited computational exploitation and increased behavioural exploration characterise PwMUD's presentation to treatment, while increased directed exploration, use of past choice outcomes and choice consistency predict greater reductions of methamphetamine use.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The explore-exploit dilemma describes the trade off that occurs any time we must choose between exploring unknown options and exploiting options we know well. Implicit in this trade off is how we value future rewards — exploiting is usually better in the short term, but in the longer term the benefits of exploration can be huge. Thus, in theory there should be a tight connection between how much people value future rewards, i.e. how much they discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards, and how likely they are to explore, with less ‘temporal discounting’ associated with more exploration. By measuring individual differences in temporal discounting and correlating them with explore-exploit behavior, we tested whether this theoretical prediction holds in practice. We used the 27-item Delay-Discounting Questionnaire to estimate temporal discounting and the Horizon Task to quantify two strategies of explore-exploit behavior: directed exploration, where information drives exploration by choice, and random exploration, where behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. We find a clear correlation between temporal discounting and directed exploration, with more temporal discounting leading to less directed exploration. Conversely, we find no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration. Unexpectedly, we find that the relationship with directed exploration appears to be driven by a correlation between temporal discounting and uncertainty seeking at short time horizons, rather than information seeking at long horizons. Taken together our results suggest a nuanced relationship between temporal discounting and explore-exploit behavior that may be mediated by multiple factors.},

  abstract = {Although we understand how serotonin receptors function at the single-cell level, what role different serotonin receptors play in regulating brain-wide activity and, in turn, human behavior, remains unknown. Here, we developed transcriptomic–neuroimaging mapping to characterize brain-wide functional signatures associated with specific serotonin receptors: serotonin receptor networks (SRNs). Probing SRNs with optogenetics–functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pharmacology in mice, we show that activation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons differentially modulates the amplitude and functional connectivity of different SRNs, showing that receptors’ spatial distributions can confer specificity not only at the local, but also at the brain-wide, network level. In humans, using resting-state functional MRI, SRNs replicate established divisions of serotonin effects on impulsivity and negative biases. These results provide compelling evidence that heterogeneous brain-wide distributions of different serotonin receptor types may underpin behaviorally distinct modes of serotonin regulation. This suggests that serotonin neurons may regulate multiple aspects of human behavior via modulation of large-scale receptor networks.},

We hypothesized that individual-orientation (the emphasis on individuals and individual achievements) and group-orientation (the emphasis on groups and efficient functioning of groups) would predict social and biological hierarchy beliefs differently within and between these cultures. As expected, intergroup hierarchy beliefs were stronger in South Korea than in the US, particularly for biological hierarchy beliefs. Multigroup structural equation modeling analyses revealed that group-orientation predicted intergroup hierarchy beliefs across cultures, but more strongly in South Korea than in the US. Also, an emphasis on individual achievements predicted social hierarchy beliefs only in the US, whereas an emphasis on roles/positions within groups predicted social and biological hierarchy beliefs only in South Korea. Results implied that intergroup hierarchy beliefs may be generally associated with group-orientation and the value of competence or efficiency in each culture.},

Both rhythms displayed effector-specific modulations, tracked spectral markers of action potentials in the local neuronal population, and showed spatially systematic phase relationships (traveling waves). Yet, alpha- and beta-band rhythms differed in their anatomical and functional properties, were weakly correlated, and traveled along opposite directions across the sensorimotor cortex. Increased alpha-band power in the somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the selected arm was associated with spatially-unspecific inhibition. Decreased beta-band power over contralateral motor cortex was associated with a focal shift from relative inhibition to excitation. These observations indicate the relevance of both inhibition and disinhibition mechanisms for precise spatiotemporal coordination of movement-related neuronal populations, and illustrate how those mechanisms are implemented through the substantially different neurophysiological properties of sensorimotor alpha- and beta-band rhythms.},

Using fMRI (               n               \,=\,31), we find that relative uncertainty is represented in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drives directed exploration, while total uncertainty is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drives random exploration. The decision value signal combining relative and total uncertainty to compute choice is reflected in motor cortex activity. The variance of this signal scales with total uncertainty, consistent with a sampling mechanism for random exploration. Overall, these results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.},

  abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic framework for analyzing control systems based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce desired outputs. In this transformation process, two di erent control strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide necessary and su cient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we derive a quantitative trade-o between the amount of information gathered by a closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 (2000) 1156) by providing new derivations of the advantage a orded by closed-loop control and by proposing an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of chaotic maps are also presented.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to plan multiple steps into the future1,2. Despite decades of research3–5, it is still debated whether skilled decision-makers plan more steps ahead than novices6–8. Traditionally, the study of expertise in planning has used board games such as chess, but the complexity of these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of planning depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive science often have a lower complexity9,10 and impose a ceiling for the depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods to show that human behaviour can be captured using a computational cognitive model based on heuristic search. To validate this model, we predict human choices, response times and eye movements. We also perform a Turing test and a reconstruction experiment. Using the model, we find robust evidence for increased planning depth with expertise in both laboratory and large-scale mobile data. Experts memorize and reconstruct board features more accurately. Using complex tasks combined with precise behavioural modelling might expand our understanding of human planning and help to bridge the gap with progress in artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Decreased dendritic spine density in the cortex is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric diseases, and the ability to promote cortical neuron growth has been hypothesized to underlie the rapid and sustained therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is essential for psychedelic-induced cortical plasticity, but it is currently unclear why some 5-HT2AR agonists promote neuroplasticity, whereas others do not. We used molecular and genetic tools to demonstrate that intracellular 5-HT2ARs mediate the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics; these results explain why serotonin does not engage similar plasticity mechanisms. This work emphasizes the role of location bias in 5-HT2AR signaling, identifies intracellular 5-HT2ARs as a therapeutic target, and raises the intriguing possibility that serotonin might not be the endogenous ligand for intracellular 5-HT2ARs in the cortex.           ,              The mechanism underlying psychedelic action                            Psychedelic compounds promote cortical structural and functional neuroplasticity through the activation of serotonin 2A receptors. However, the mechanisms by which receptor activation leads to changes in neuronal growth are still poorly defined. Vargas               et al               . found that activation of intracellular serotonin 2A receptors is responsible for the plasticity-promoting and antidepressant-like properties of psychedelic compounds, but serotonin may not be the natural ligand for those intracellular receptors (see the Perspective by Hess and Gould). —PRS                        ,              Membrane-permeable psychedelics promote cortical neuron growth by activating intracellular serotonin 2A receptors.},

  abstract = {Serotonergic psychedelics possess considerable therapeutic potential. Although 5-HT2A receptor activation mediates psychedelic effects, prototypical psychedelics activate both 5-HT2A-Gq/11 and β-arrestin2 signaling, making their respective roles unclear. To elucidate this, we developed a series of 5-HT2A-selective ligands with varying Gq efficacies, including β-arrestin-biased ligands. We show that 5-HT2A-Gq but not 5-HT2A-β-arrestin2 efficacy predicts psychedelic potential, assessed using head-twitch response (HTR) magnitude in male mice. We further show that disrupting Gq-PLC signaling attenuates the HTR and a threshold level of Gq activation is required to induce psychedelic-like effects, consistent with the fact that certain 5-HT2A partial agonists (e.g., lisuride) are non-psychedelic. Understanding the role of 5-HT2A-Gq efficacy in psychedelic-like psychopharmacology permits rational development of non-psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists. We also demonstrate that β-arrestin-biased 5-HT2A receptor agonists induce receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis, and have an anti-psychotic-like behavioral profile. Overall, 5-HT2A receptor signaling can be fine-tuned to generate ligands with properties distinct from classical psychedelics.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with a number of deficits in decision-making, but the scope, nature, and cause of these deficits are not completely understood. Here we focus on a particular type of decision, known as the explore/exploit dilemma, in which people must choose between exploiting options that yield relatively known rewards and exploring more ambiguous options of uncertain reward probability or magnitude. Previous work has shown that healthy people use two distinct strategies to decide when to explore: directed exploration, which involves choosing options that would reduce uncertainty about the reward values (information seeking), and random exploration (exploring by chance), which describes behavioral variability that is not goal directed. We administered a recently developed gambling task designed to quantify both directed and random exploration to 108 patients with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 33 healthy volunteers (HVs). We found that PSZ patients show reduced directed exploration relative to HVs, but no difference in random exploration. Moreover, patients’ directed exploration behavior clusters into two qualitatively different behavioral phenotypes. In the first phenotype, which accounts for the majority of the patients (79\%) and is consistent with previously reported behavior, directed exploration is only marginally (but significantly) reduced, suggesting that these patients can use directed exploration, but at a slightly lower level than community controls. In contrast, the second phenotype, comprising 21\% of patients, exhibits a form of “extreme ambiguity aversion,” in which they almost never choose more informative options, even when they are clearly of higher value. Moreover, in PSZ, deficits in directed exploration were related to measures of intellectual function, whereas random exploration was related to positive symptoms. Taken together, our results suggest that schizophrenia has differential effects on directed and random exploration and that investigating the explore/exploit dilemma in psychosis patients may reveal subgroups of patients with qualitatively different patterns of exploration.},

  abstract = {Abstract           When facing an unfamiliar environment, animals need to explore to gain new knowledge about which actions provide reward, but also put the newly acquired knowledge to use as quickly as possible. Optimal reinforcement learning strategies should therefore assess the uncertainties of these action– reward associations and utilise them to inform decision making. We propose a novel model whereby direct and indirect striatal pathways act together to estimate both the mean and variance of reward distributions, and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons provide transient novelty signals, facilitating effective uncertainty-driven exploration. We utilised electrophysiological recording data to verify our model of the basal ganglia, and we fitted exploration strategies derived from the model to data from behavioural experiments. We also compared the performance of directed exploration strategies inspired by our basal ganglia model with classic variants of upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy in simulation. The exploration strategies inspired by the basal ganglia model performed better than the classic algorithms in simulation in some cases, and we found qualitatively similar results in fitting model to behavioural data compared with the fitting of more idealised normative models with less implementation level detail. Overall, our results suggest that transient dopamine levels in the basal ganglia that encode novelty could contribute to an uncertainty representation which efficiently drives exploration in reinforcement learning.                        Author summary             Humans and other animals learn from rewards and losses resulting from their actions to maximise their chances of survival. In many cases, a trial-and-error process is necessary to determine the most rewarding action in a certain context. During this process, determining how much resource should be allocated to acquiring information (“exploration”) and how much should be allocated to utilising the existing information to maximise reward (“exploitation”) is key to the overall effectiveness, i.e., the maximisation of total reward obtained with a certain amount of effort. We propose a theory whereby an area within the mammalian brain called the basal ganglia integrates current knowledge about the mean reward, reward uncertainty and novelty of an action in order to implement an algorithm which optimally allocates resources between exploration and exploitation. We verify our theory using behavioural experiments and electrophysiological recording, and show in simulations that the model also achieves good performance in comparison with established benchmark algorithms.},

Although both cognitive processes can be formalized as Bayesian inference, they are commonly studied using different experimental frameworks, making their formal comparison difficult. Here, by framing a reversal learning task either as cue-based or outcome-based inference, we found that humans perceive the same volatile environment as more stable when inferring its hidden state by interaction with uncertain outcomes than by observation of equally uncertain cues. Multivariate patterns of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity reflected this behavioral difference in the neural interaction between inferred beliefs and incoming evidence, an effect originating from associative regions in the temporal lobe. Together, these findings indicate that the degree of control over the sampling of volatile environments shapes human learning and decision-making under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Gambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction associated with impairments in value-based decision-making and behavioral flexibility and might be linked to changes in the dopamine system. Maximizing long-term rewards requires a flexible trade-off between the exploitation of known options and the exploration of novel options for information gain. This exploration-exploitation trade-off is thought to depend on dopamine neurotransmission. We hypothesized that human gamblers would show a reduction in directed (uncertainty-based) exploration, accompanied by changes in brain activity in a fronto-parietal exploration-related network. Twenty-three frequent, non-treatment seeking gamblers and twenty-three healthy matched controls (all male) performed a four-armed bandit task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Computational modeling using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation revealed signatures of directed exploration, random exploration, and perseveration in both groups. Gamblers showed a reduction in directed exploration, whereas random exploration and perseveration were similar between groups. Neuroimaging revealed no evidence for group differences in neural representations of basic task variables (expected value, prediction errors). Our hypothesis of reduced frontal pole (FP) recruitment in gamblers was not supported. Exploratory analyses showed that during directed exploration, gamblers showed reduced parietal cortex and substantia-nigra/ventral-tegmental-area activity. Cross-validated classification analyses revealed that connectivity in an exploration-related network was predictive of group status, suggesting that connectivity patterns might be more predictive of problem gambling than univariate effects. Findings reveal specific reductions of strategic exploration in gamblers that might be linked to altered processing in a fronto-parietal network and/or changes in dopamine neurotransmission implicated in GD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Wiehler et al. (2021) report that gamblers rely less on the strategic exploration of unknown, but potentially better rewards during reward learning. This is reflected in a related network of brain activity. Parameters of this network can be used to predict the presence of problem gambling behavior in participants.},

  abstract = {All adaptive organisms face the fundamental tradeoff between pursuing a known reward (exploitation) and sampling lesser-known options in search of something better (exploration). Theory suggests at least two strategies for solving this dilemma: a directed strategy in which choices are explicitly biased toward information seeking, and a random strategy in which decision noise leads to exploration by chance. In this work we investigated the extent to which humans use these two strategies. In our “Horizon task,” participants made explore– exploit decisions in two contexts that differed in the number of choices that they would make in the future (the time horizon). Participants were allowed to make either a single choice in each game (horizon 1), or 6 sequential choices (horizon 6), giving them more opportunity to explore. By modeling the behavior in these two conditions, we were able to measure exploration-related changes in decision making and quantify the contributions of the two strategies to behavior. We found that participants were more information seeking and had higher decision noise with the longer horizon, suggesting that humans use both strategies to solve the exploration– exploitation dilemma. We thus conclude that both information seeking and choice variability can be controlled and put to use in the service of exploration.},

  abstract = {Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p {$<$} .01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our laboratory (N = 33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p {$<$} .001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.},

  abstract = {To study the neural basis of behavior, we require methods to sensitively and accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at ultra-high densities ({$>$}1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), with 6 μm center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neuron's electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves \textasciitilde 3-fold. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging, we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75\% success among three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.},

  abstract = {Objective We tested the hypothesis that there are 2 distinct phenotypes of Parkinson tremor, based on interindividual differences in the response of resting tremor to dopaminergic medication. We also investigated whether this pattern is specific to tremor by comparing interindividual differences in the dopamine response of tremor to that of bradykinesia. Methods In this exploratory study, we performed a levodopa challenge in 76 tremulous patients with Parkinson tremor. Clinical scores (Movement Disorders Society–sponsored version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III) were collected “off” and “on” a standardized dopaminergic challenge (200/50 mg dispersible levodopa-benserazide). In both sessions, resting tremor intensity was quantified using accelerometry, both during rest and during cognitive coactivation. Bradykinesia was quantified using a speeded keyboard test. We calculated the distribution of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia. In 41 patients, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled dopaminergic challenge was repeated after approximately 6 months. Results The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from a normal distribution. A cluster analysis on 3 clinical and electrophysiologic markers of tremor dopamine-responsiveness revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed this classification. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremor had greater disease severity and tended to have a higher prevalence of dyskinesia. Conclusion Parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping phenotypes, based on the dopamine response. These tremor phenotypes may be associated with different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, requiring a different therapeutic approach.},

  abstract = {The explore-exploit dilemma occurs anytime we must choose between exploring unknown options for information and exploiting known resources for reward. Previous work suggests that people use two different strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: directed exploration, driven by information seeking, and random exploration, driven by decision noise. Here, we show that these two strategies rely on different neural systems. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the right frontopolar cortex, we were able to selectively inhibit directed exploration while leaving random exploration intact. This suggests a causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration and that directed and random exploration rely on (at least partially) dissociable neural systems.},

  abstract = {Exposure to social stress and dysregulated serotonergic neurotransmission have both been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. However, the serotonergic circuit involved in stress vulnerability is still unknown. Here, we explored whether a serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe (DR) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) influences vulnerability to social stress. We identified a distinct, anatomically and functionally defined serotonergic subpopulation in the DR that projects to the VTA (5-HTDR→VTA neurons). Moreover, we found that susceptibility to social stress decreased the firing activity of 5-HTDR→VTA neurons. Importantly, the bidirectional manipulation of 5-HTDR→VTA neurons could modulate susceptibility to social stress. Our findings reveal that the activity of 5-HTDR→VTA neurons may be an essential factor in determining individual levels of susceptibility to social stress and suggest that targeting specific serotonergic circuits may aid the development of therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders., Serotonin is important in depression-like behavior. Here the authors show that dorsal raphe neurons that project to the ventral tegmental area are involved in regulating stress responses in mice.},
